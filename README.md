### JDBC Team Project:
   #### In Workbench:
   - Create a table that stores your Employee from the first team project
   - Create an address table that stores address information
   - Create a Department table that stores Department information
   - An Employee has a Department and an Address (work on Department first, Address optional)
  
  #### In Java
- Create Models for Employee, Department and Address
- Create DAO interfaces for Employee, Department, and Address
- Create DAO Classes that implement those interfaces
- Create a Static Singleton Factory connection manager that reads from a config.properties file
- Create a Scanner interface that can read data from the database and print it to the screen
- Use the Scanner to prompt users to input new employee information and write it to the database
- Store the Department that the Employee is a part of in the database
- OPTIONAL: collect and record the employeeâ€™s address information as well (edited)
